U-Dbu project
================

First Dbu for Web made with UT (Uhttpd2 + TWeb)


The new way of programming the web with harbour. Fast, powerful, reliable, robust... and only harbour!


Run the server by starting app.exe and then from a browser put the url localhost:81


You are free to use, modify and make the changes that you most need. To recompile the application you must run go64.bat. Match the paths for a correct compilation. In this first version the system uses the 64-bit MSVC compiler.

Enjoy U-Dbu
